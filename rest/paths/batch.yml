  description: "Batch binding provides a mechanism to perform several Subutai commands in the container in batch,
passed in a single JSON message. Initially, the purpose of this command was internal for SS <-> Agent communication,
yet it may be invoked manually from the CLI.
The response from a batch command returns a JSON array with each element representing the results (response) from each command (request) in the batch:
the positions of responses correlate with the request position in the array"
