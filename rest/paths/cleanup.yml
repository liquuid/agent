  description: "Cleanup simply removes every resource associated with a Subutai container or template:
data, network, configs, etc.
The destroy command always runs each step in \"force\" mode to provide reliable deletion results;
even if some instance components were already removed, the destroy command will continue to perform all operations once again while ignoring possible underlying errors: i.e. missing configuration files."
