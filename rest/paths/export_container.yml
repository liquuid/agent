  description: "Export prepares an archive from a template in the `/mnt/lib/lxc/tmpdir/` path.
This archive can be moved to another Subutai peer and deployed as ready-to-use template or uploaded to Subutai's global template repository to make it
widely available for others to use.

Export consist of two steps if the target is a container:
container promotion to template (see \"promote\" command) and packing the template into the archive.
If already a template just the packing of the archive takes place.

Configuration values for template metadata parameters can be overridden on export, like the recommended container size when the template is cloned using `-s` option."
