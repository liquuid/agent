  description: "Promote turns a Subutai container into container template which may be cloned with \"clone\" command.
Promote executes several simple steps, such as dropping a container's configuration to default values,
dumping the list of installed packages (this step requires the target container to still be running),
and setting the container's filesystem to read-only to prevent changes."
