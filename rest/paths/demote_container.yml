  description: "Converts template into regular Subutai container.

A Subutai template is a \"locked down\" container only to be used for cloning purposes. It cannot be started, and its file system cannot be modified: it's read-only.
Normal operational containers are promoted into templates, but sometimes you might want to demote them back to regular containers.
This is what the demote sub command does: it reverts a template without children back into a normal container.
Demoted container will use NAT network interface and dynamic IP address if opposite options are not specified."
