  description: "BackupContainer takes a snapshots of each container's volume and stores it in the `/mnt/backups/container_name/datetime/` directory.
A full backup creates a delta-file of each BTRFS subvolume. An incremental backup (default) creates a delta-file with the difference of changes between the current and last snapshots.
All deltas are compressed to archives in `/mnt/backups/` directory (container_datetime.tar.gz or container_datetime_Full.tar.gz for full backup).
A changelog file can be found next to backups archive (container_datetime_changelog.txt or container_datetime_Full_changelog.txt) which contains a list of changes made between two backups."
